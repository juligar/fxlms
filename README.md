Filtered-x LMS algorithm simulation in Python/
Sample by sample/
Instead of using np.convolve we are manually performing the convolutions for each transfer path/
Initialization Parameters:
N=4000
L=10
mu=0.005/
We have modeled the P(z) and S(z) assigning delay values.
Let's consider the delay of the Primary Path P(z) is bigger than S(z).
